# Dungeons-Dynamic-Matrices
Simple game i created some years ago after learning C++ OOP to test my skills

I implemented the fstream library to save a .txt file with the players scores, 
to make it functional you must open the DeDM Mark VI Vers√£o Final.cpp file and
modify lines 395 and 407 changing the saving path to the directory of your choice.
